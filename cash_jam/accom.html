		<h2>Accommodation</h2>
		<p>Being a seaside town, there is no shortage of accommodation 
		  in Ilfracombe. Please bear in mind, however, that we are getting 
		  married in between two half-term weeks so it may be worth booking 
		  any accommodation sooner rather later. There will also be a wedding 
		  at Tunnels Beaches the day before ours, so there might be some 
		  competition for rooms.</p>

		<p>Accommodation in Ilfracombe seems to span the full spectrum, 
		  from Fawlty Towers upwards. There are some nice hotels along Torr Park 
		  (about five minutes walk from Tunnels Beaches), although these are at 
		  the more expensive end of the spectrum. There are a few recommendations 
		  on the <a target="blank" href="http://www.tunnelsbeaches.co.uk/weddingguests.html"> Tunnels 
		    Beaches website. </a> We, along with the wedding party, will be staying 
		  at The Hamptons on Torr Park so they won't be showing any availability.</p>

		<p><a target="blank" href="http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Hotels-g191252-Ilfracombe_Devon_England-Hotels.html">Tripadvisor</a> 
		  is also worth checking out for recommendations.</p>

		<p>We visited some hotels earlier this year and had a look around 
		  the Elmfield Hotel so we can recommend that as a place to stay. They 
		  will also take larger group bookings and will
		  give a discount if all the rooms are booked at once.
		  We have also heard that Norbury House Hotel will be closed over the 
		  wedding weekend, but it might be worth checking just to be sure.</p>

		<p>For larger groups, Tunnels Beaches also own a couple of properties 
		  that can be rented for the weekend: Tides (up to 10 adults + 4 children) 
		  and the Bath House (up to 18 adults and 6 children). Both of these houses
		  are particularly lovely (and reasonably priced) and can be booked 
		  directly through the venue. More details can be found 
		  <a target="blank" href="http://www.tunnelsbeaches.co.uk/weddingaccommodation.html">here</a> </p>

		<p>For the more adventurous, there are also a number of caravan parks and 
		  camp sites in the local area.</p>

		<h3>Local information</h3>
		<p>If you're after fish & chips then Ilfracombe won't disappoint! 
		  There are also a surprising large number of nice places to eat, 
		  a number of which are listed on the 
		  <a target="blank" href="http://www.tunnelsbeaches.co.uk/weddingguests.html"> 
		    Tunnels Beaches website </a> (scroll about half way down). You basically need to head down 
		to Fore Street and there are lots of nice restaurants and eateries there. We ate The Terrace (tapas), 
		which all very nice. </p>
		
		<p>For pubs, the Ship & Pilot on Broad Street (down by the harbour) 
		  is recommended. </p>

		<p>There are a few things to check out in Ilfracombe. If you are a fan of Damien Hirst then "Verity" is 
		a must see. Even if you are not a fan of his, have a look anyway. You can also measure your triple jump distance
		against Jonathan Edward's distance (along Wilder Road). If instead of jumping, you prefer walking then there is
		the South-West Coastal path. It is a great walk no matter how far you decide to go.</p>
		<p>You can also hop onto a ferry and visit Lundy island. There are also lots of beaches relatively near Ilfracombe  
		  e.g. Woolacombe, Braunton, Saunton. If you are going to be around on Sunday, we are hoping
		  to go to Woolacombe anyway so fingers crossed for beach weather!!</p>
