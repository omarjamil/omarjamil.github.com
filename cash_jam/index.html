    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>Marriage is seen as a worthwhile cultural endeavour by many 
      adult members of the human genus. The opportunity to spend one’s 
      life in close physical and emotional proximity with another like-minded 
      adult promotes participation in courting rituals unique to the Primate Order.  
      This has led to increased research interest in the Marriage Project.
      </p>
    <p>
      A successful courting ritual performed in 2007 led to a decision to run a test 
      of the Proposal Model in 2010. The equation for determining marriage success was 
      derived and used as the theoretical underpinning of the Proposal Model. 
      A successful run of the Proposal Model was carried out on 25th December 2010 
      and the authors are now running the Wedding Model in phase two of the Marriage 
      Project. After completing the commissioning phase, the authors will be running a full 
      test of the Wedding Model on Saturday 26th October 2013 at Tunnels Beaches, 
      Ilfracombe, North Devon from 3pm. An audience of peer reviewers are invited 
      to attend and test the hypothesis that Lisa and Omar will live happily ever after.

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      The Wessex Lane Wardenal Team provides an interesting case study for 
      researchers interested in the Marriage Project, due to the clustering of a 
      high number of individuals entering into this project after joining the team.	
    </p>
    <p>
     The current project began in 2007 when a <i>Homar jamilensis</i> (‘Omar’) decided 
     to initiate a courtship ritual with an <i>Auslisapithecus cashmorensis</i> (‘Lisa’). 
     Initial signs were encouraging, and after a pilot phase of approx. 3.5 years, 
     Omar decided to begin work on the mathematical underpinning for the next phase 
     of the Marriage Project: the Proposal Model.
    </p>
    <p>
     With an R value of 0.98 for the correlation between their interests and sense 
     of humour, and an irritation index of just 0.10, Omar decided to run his Proposal
     Model on 25th December 2010. It was hypothesised that this date would have the 
     highest likelihood to confound Lisa and the null hypothesis was rejected when 
     she responded, “Sure, why not.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Full commissioning work of the Wedding Model was started in mid 2012 and since
     that time extensive preparations have been underway to ensure smooth running of 
     the Wedding Model when it goes live on 26th October 2013. This study explores the 
     processes involved in designing and running this Model and lays the groundwork 
     for future research into the more enigmatic Happily Ever After Model. 
    </p>

  </br>					
  <h2><a href="wedding.html">Materials and Methods </a></h2>
  <h3>(Directions, Accommodation, Local information)</h3>
  <p>
   A successful run of the Wedding Model relies on a number of variables. This section 
   outlines the key variables involved in the execution of the Wedding Model, namely the 
   space-time coordinates of the Wedding Model testing location and the accommodation 
   facilities during the test. Details are also given on the local environment in which 
   the Wedding Model will be situated.  
  </p>
  <p>
   The authors do not believe gifts to be a necessary parameter in the Wedding Model. 
   As this is not a view shared by all researchers, appropriate details are provided.

	<h2><a href="wedding.html"> Results </a></h2>
	<h3>(The Big Day: Venue, Timings, Arrangements)</h3>
	Preliminary analysis has indicated the following results:
	
	<ol>
	  <li> The Wedding Model testing will be taking place at Tunnels Beaches,  
	    Bath Place, Ilfracombe, EX34 8AN on Saturday 26th October 2013. </li></br>
	  <li> The Wedding Model run time will be from 3pm onwards, so please arrive 
	    around 2.30pm. </li></br>
	  <li> The evening component of the Model (evening reception) will 
	    begin around 8pm and will terminate around 2am. </li></br>
	  <li> Parking at the venue is limited, so if it is possible to park at 
	    your accommodation, this would be much appreciated and will make 
	    it easier for evening guests to find spaces. </li></br>
          <i>Please click on the section heading for further information.</i>
	</ol>

</br></br>
	<h2><a href="dayafter.html">Discussion and Conclusions</a></h2>
	<h3>(The Day After)</h3>
	<p>
	The results outlined in the previous sections can be interpreted as 
	a successful test of the Wedding Model. However, further research is 
	now required to test the long term sustainability of the Model. 
	</p>
	<p>
	The authors intend to begin this research as soon as possible after 
	the completion of the Wedding Model. Post wedding-project processing 
	of the results will begin with initial runs of the Happily Ever 
	After Model from Sunday 27th October onwards. Peers are also invited 
	to join the authors in conducting this study. Solar radiation intensity and 
	precipitation probability permitting, this will be on Woolacombe beach from 
	12 noon onwards. This 
	should provide an ample opportunity to discuss the outcomes of the 
	Wedding Model and the implications this has for the Happily Ever After 
	Model.
