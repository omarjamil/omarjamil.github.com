		<h2>The Day After</h2>
		<p>We appreciate that due to the distances many of you will 
		  have to travel, you may need to head back home quite early on the Sunday. 
		  However, if you have a little more time to spare, we thought we should 
		  try and make the most of some of the awesome beaches that the North Devon 
		  coast has to offer. The plan, weather permitting, is to go to Woolacombe Beach, 
		  about 10mins drive from Ilfracombe (there's also a bus that runs between 
		  the two and Barnstaple). Let's meet at <strong>The Tides Inn</strong>, Beach Road, Woolacombe, 
		    Devon, EX34 7BP <strong>12 pm</strong> onwards.</p> 

		<p>We will try and bring some beach games along, but for the less active, 
		  we will also have beer from the fledgling Cashmore-Jamil Brewery to keep 
		  you entertained.</p> 

		<p>If, in the unlikely event, the weather isn't beach friendly, 
		  we will try and find a cafe/pub to hang out in. Either way, we can do something fun!</p>
