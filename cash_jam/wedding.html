		<h2>On the day</h2>
		<p>The wedding ceremony will start at 3pm, so please make sure that 
		  you arrive in good time and by 2.45pm at the latest (so as not to 
		  bump into us arriving!).</p>

		<h3>Evening festivities</h3>
		<p>The evening doo-dah will start at 8pm. The bar will stay open till 1am 
		  (the clocks go back at 2am). Also, let's not forget this is the end of October in England! 
		  So something warm for the evening might be needed. </p>
		
		<p>Venue address: Tunnels Beaches, &nbsp; Bath Place, &nbsp; Ilfracombe, &nbsp; Devon, &nbsp EX34 8AN</p>
		
		<h3>Photos - a request</h3>
		<p>We will have an awesome photographer, Hannah Millard 
		  (<a target="blank" href="http://www.hannahmillardphotography.com">check her out</a>), 
		  who will be with us throughout the day. We therefore politely ask that 
		  you don't take any photos during the ceremony. This will not only help 
		  Hannah take her photos, but more importantly, we want to turn round after 
		  the ceremony finishes and see all your lovely faces, not a bank of phones 
		  and cameras - we're not ready for the paparazzi treatment! </p>
		<p>Of course, please take lots of photos once the ceremony is finished 
		  - the more cringeworthy and embarrassing the better (we might regret saying that). </p>
		<h3>Children</h3>
		<p>Unfortunately, due to the small size and layout of our venue, 
		  we will be unable to accommodate children during the day time events. 
		  Children are welcome to join us in the evening, when there will be more 
		  space to run around.</p>
		<p> We hope that this does not cause anyone unnecessary problems, 
		  but if it does, please let us know as soon as possible.</p>
		<h3>Gifts</h3>
		<p>Like many couples we’re not asking for, or indeed expecting, any gifts. 
		  We appreciate the expense of attending a wedding and don’t want people to 
		  have to factor the cost of a gift into that expense.</p> 
		<p>Some people have asked us about gifts, however. We don't have any specific 
		   requests, but if you are short of ideas then any sort of contribution 
		  towards our honeymoon would be more than gratefully received.</p> 
                <p>As you know, we are both avid travellers, so the choice for where to 
		  go for this special trip was particularly difficult to make.  Therefore we've decided
		  to go somewhere that will allow Lisa to enjoy swimming in sea 
		  water slightly above freezing and allow Omar to indulge his inner 
		  Ray Mears --- so we're going to Australia!</p>
 		<p>We are booking the trip with Trailfinders and have created a wedding 
		  list with them (Surname: "Cashmore" or "Jamil"; Ref: 5BBCPF): <a href="https://secure.trailfinders.co.uk/WeddingListService/contribute/WedGiftform.jsp"
